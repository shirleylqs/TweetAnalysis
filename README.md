# TweetAnalysis

This project explores the potential of Twitter as a valuable source for identifying and understanding emerging trends and topics in education, specifically focusing on e-learning. By analyzing various aspects of tweets such as user affiliations, geographic locations, timestamps, content, and sentiment, this study aims to provide insights into the current e-learning landscape and its evolution over time.

The following tasks have been undertaken to achieve the project's goal:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The Tweepy API was utilized to randomly collect 500 GB of recent Twitter data. The raw data was subsequently preprocessed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to remove stop words, punctuation, and URLs. This cleaned data was then employed for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Employing NLTK, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, a sentiment analysis model was developed to classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral categories. A logistic regression model was trained on the preprocessed data for this purpose.
3. Near-Duplicate Analysis: MinHashLSH and Jaccard distance with thresholds of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 were used to identify and quantify the presence of near-duplicate tweets. The analysis revealed that approximately 11-19% of the tweets in the sample were detected as near-duplicates.
4. Statistical Analysis and Visualization: A comprehensive statistical analysis of the cleaned dataset was conducted to identify trends and patterns within the e-learning domain. Various visualization techniques, such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, were employed to examine the distribution of tweets across different dimensions, including time, user affiliations, and geographic locations. This enabled the detection of patterns, the understanding of the dynamics of e-learning discussions on Twitter, and the identification of areas of interest and emerging trends in the field.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates that Twitter can serve as a valuable tool for understanding e-learning trends, providing real-time insights into the ever-evolving educational landscape. By analyzing tweets, a better understanding of the current state of e-learning can be gained, enabling the identification of emerging trends and contributing to informed decision-making for educational stakeholders.
